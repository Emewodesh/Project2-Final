  <div class="swag3"><center>We to this day still have the struggle of people not believing in climate change. We have one of the most important people in our government not doing much about it because they are choosing not to believe in it. This is not something you write down and set aside, it will affect the future generation of kids if they choose not to act. They state in an article that " In February, the New York Times editorial board wondered whether addressing the climate crisis was 'merely a cover for a wish-list of progressive policies and a not-so-subtle effort to move the Democratic Party to the left?'" It's disappointing that the people we need to give a platform on this situation choose to send it aside when instead we need to bring it to the people and publically address it.</center></div>
