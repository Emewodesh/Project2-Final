  <div class="yolo4">"The cryosphere - the frozen water on Earth - is melting. A warmer atmosphere causes the planet's snowpack, glaciers and sea and freshwater ice to melt rapidly." As shown in this quote, our climate is getting warmer and glaciers are melting and the cold air is changing. Our environment is changing and animals such as the polar bear to the left are endangered due to our climate. Temperature is getting warmer and even human health is at risk. We are all "experiencing the effects of climate change."</div>
